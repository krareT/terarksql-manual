More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]\'s imperialist expansion ? in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France\'s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.\" {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Benedict | author-link = Benedict Anderson | title = In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 28 | pages = 85?129 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July?August 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} </blockquote> According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].</ref>\n\nNumerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], President [[Marie Fran?ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] of France, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], King [[Umberto I of Italy]], President [[William McKinley]] of the United States, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and King [[George I of Greece]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} McKinley\'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = American Experience {{!}} Emma Goldman {{!}} Transcript {{!}} PBS|url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/filmmore/pt.html|website = www.pbs.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}</ref>\n\nPropaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914?1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===\n{{Main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)||Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Revolutions of 1917?23}}\n[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}</ref> However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed.

Its [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.\nNOTE: Since it is the ratio of all reflected radiation to incident radiation it will include the diffuse AND the specular radiation reflected. It is, however, common to assume a surface reflects in either a totally specular manner or a totally diffuse manner, as this can simplify calculations.\n\nAlbedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation, except for [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surfaces]], which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface, but albedo is very useful as a first approximation.\n\nThe albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] sustainable-rating systems for buildings. The average overall albedo of Earth, its \'\'planetary albedo\'\', is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.<ref>Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8</ref>\n\nThe term was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work \'\'[[Photometria]]\'\'.\n\n==Terrestrial albedo==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\"\n|+ Sample albedos\n|-\n!

Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.<ref name=\"PhysicsWorld\">{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo ? from Eric Weisstein\'s World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.<ref name=\"Goode\"/> This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.\n\n[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|200px|left|2003?2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]\nEarth\'s surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]\'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites.

These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.<ref name=\"BlueskyAlbedo\"/>\n\n==Astronomical albedo==\nThe albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (\"phase angle\"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.\n\n[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.\n\nIn detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.\n\nThe correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is:<ref name=\"bruton\">{{cite web\n  |title=Conversion of Absolute Magnitude to Diameter for Minor Planets\n  |publisher=Department of Physics & Astronomy (Stephen F.

The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north.<ref name=Winston>{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818?827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099<0818:TACOZM>2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}</ref> The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.<ref name=Winston/>\n\n===Insolation effects ===\nThe intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rain forest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Climate and weather===\nAlbedo affects [[climate]] and drives [[weather]]. All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos. Essentially, for the driving of weather, there are two types of albedo regions on Earth: Land and ocean. Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of [[air masses]], depending on latitude and therefore [[insolation]]: Warm and dry, which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses; warm and wet, which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans; cold and dry which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar land masses; and cold and wet, which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar oceans. Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures, and the masses develop into [[pressure systems]]. High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure, driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere, and south to north in the lower; however due to the spinning of Earth, the [[Coriolis effect]] further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the [[jet stream]]s.\n\n===Albedo?temperature feedback===\nWhen an area\'s albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow?temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow?temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.\n\n===Snow===\nSnow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.<ref>Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), Remote sensing of ice and snow. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.</ref> Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice?albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.<ref name = \"Nat. Geo\">[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 \"Changing Greenland ? Melt Zone\"] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in \'\'[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]\'\' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010</ref>\nHence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.\n\n===Small-scale effects===\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.<ref name=\"ranknfile-ue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions.

In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Betts | first1 = RA | date = 2000 | title = Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187?190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969}}</ref> Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]].

[[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.<ref name=\"mmutrees\" />\n\nStudies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.<ref name=\"Betts\" />\n\n===Water===\nWater reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).\n[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&nbsp;?C (refractive index=1.333)]]\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.<ref name=\"Fresnel\" />\n\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.\n\nNote that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh \'black\' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.\n\n===Clouds===\n[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water.

According to Barbara Branden, the change was made for dramatic reasons??Rand believed that titling the novel \'The Strike\' would have revealed the mystery element of the novel prematurely.\"\n\nShe did this with all of her novels, giving them titles that would help remind her what the central theme was, but then changing the titles to something that would not be understood by the reader until after the novel had been read. This is explained in Anthem Centennial Edition with Introduction by Ayn Rand (ISBN-10: 0452286352 ISBN-13: 978-0452286351), at least.\n\nThe above sentence makes it appear it is a quality of the book, while it should emphasize it was really a quality of the author\'s style.\n\nFor example:\nAirtight became We The Living\nEgo became Anthem\nSecond Hand Lives became The Fountainhead\n\nSmall suggestion to an excellent article. <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">?Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/199.80.142.62|199.80.142.62]] ([[User talk:199.80.142.62|talk]]) 19:08, 18 September 2009 </span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP -->\n\n== \"100 best novels of the 20th century\" blurb should be removed [uncredible source]. ==\n\nThe source being used is an Internet poll: http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/\n\nWhich is highly sensitive to \'blitz voting\', which is also why non-professional reviews on Metacritic are rarely used, and even looking at that list 4 out of the top 10 are Rand books, and 3 out of the top 10 are Hubbard\'s, showing a very high Libertarian slant. It\'s not nearly as subject-varied as the professional list on that same page (which doesn\'t include the book in its top 100). <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">? Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.69.69.30|184.69.69.30]] ([[User talk:184.69.69.30|talk]]) 20:21, 23 September 2013? (UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->\n\n== Sourcing ==\n\nI\'ve just tagged a few paragraphs for sourcing issues but could tag many more. For example, we say that John Galt expresses Rand\'s personal opinion but we don\'t seem to have any verification of that: he is just a character in a novel. Novelists create many characters, some traits of which may reflect the writer\'s own opinion while other traits may not; or none may be a reflection; or (in rare cases) all may be a reflection. We cannot interpret primary sources, such as the book itself, because that constitutes [[WP:OR|original research]]. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 11:35, 22 October 2013 (UTC)\n:I\'ve just tagged the entire \"Theory of sex\" section as OR. The rationale should be obvious. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:46, 22 October 2013 (UTC)\n::Rand refers to and quotes from Galt\'s speech in her philosophical essays, confirming that his words reflected her views. There\'s not interpretation required, so no possibility of original research. [[User:MilesMoney|MilesMoney]] ([[User talk:MilesMoney|talk]]) 05:58, 23 October 2013 (UTC)\n\n== Reason magazine ==\n\nWe currently say \"... the title of the libertarian magazine, \'\'Reason: Free Minds, Free Markets\'\', is taken directly from John Galt ...\". That is unsourced, although a quote from Galt is present. What concerns me more is that a look at [[Reason (magazine)]] and in particular at the image shown in the infobox there suggests that \'\'Free Minds, Free Markets\'\' is a strapline, not a title. The article title itself seems to bear that out, so perhaps this sentence needs to be tweaked as well as sourced? - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:03, 22 October 2013 (UTC)\n:Based on http://cloudfront-assets.reason.com/assets/db/1350587890858.pdf, it\'s a strapline, albeit one that\'s used consistently and prominently. It\'s also found in it\'s self-description at http://reason.com/about. I don\'t believe there\'s any doubt that Rand is the source of the quote. [[User:MilesMoney|MilesMoney]] ([[User talk:MilesMoney|talk]]) 06:12, 23 October 2013 (UTC)\n\n== Movie profitable? ==\n\nThe text says that the movie turned a profit on home video, but this is not supported by the citation and I find it a dubious claim.  If there isn\'t a [[WP:RS]] for it, it should be removed.KaturianKaturian 12:51, 20 September 2014 (UTC)\n: Added information about the DVD and Blue Ray sales.  As I suspected, the movie still lost money.KaturianKaturian 14:49, 21 September 2014 (UTC)'
